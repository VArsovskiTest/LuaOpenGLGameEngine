dotnet publish -c Debug -o C:\_Publish --no-restore /p:DeleteExistingFiles=true
// dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=ProfileName /p:DeleteExistingFiles=true

OR directly publish to the inetpub site folder:
dotnet publish -c Debug -o "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\YourApiSite" /p:DeleteExistingFiles=true

Iusrmgr.msc => create new user => set Password (whichever, does not have to be your login one)
=> add the user to group: IIS_IUSRS
=> set to AppPool identity
=> create the folder with api-name (minimal-editor-api for ex.) in C:\inetpub\wwwroot
=> Add permissions to that folder for IIS_IUSRS user group
=> In Program.cs https redicrection is set to port 4401 (so add Basic Binding with http to port 4400 and https to port 4401)
    => If want to change that then better use an EnvironmentVariable like ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT for ex.
=> Setup Firewall For ports (4400, 4401) (or whichever ports you chose to use for the API)
=> Set up url bindings for your IIS site in drivers/etc/hosts file, for ex:
    127.0.0.1    minimal-editor-api.local # Local API site
    127.0.0.1    minimal-editor.local     # If also hosting the frontend manually
=> For further troubleshoot (https/SSL issues or similar): EventViewer => Windows/Applications

// PWSH: dotnet dev-certs https --trust // Make sure IIS Development Certificate is already trusted

BONUS:

Setup-Certificate steps:

Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
Step 2: Create the self-signed certificate
Run one of the commands below depending on your needs.

PowerShellNew-SelfSignedCertificate `
  -DnsName "localhost","minimal-editor-api.local","127.0.0.1" `
  -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" `
  -FriendlyName "Local API Dev Cert (localhost + minimal-editor-api.local)" `
  -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5) `
  -KeyUsage DigitalSignature,KeyEncipherment `
  -Type SSLServerAuthentication

OR (a bit more Wildcard version with *.local)

PowerShellNew-SelfSignedCertificate `
  -DnsName "*.local","localhost" `
  -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" `
  -FriendlyName "Wildcard *.local Dev Cert" `
  -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5) `
  -KeyUsage DigitalSignature,KeyEncipherment `
  -Type SSLServerAuthentication

IMPORTANT: For production: Never use self-signed — get real certs (Let's Encrypt, etc.).

Step 3: Copy the Thumbprint (long hex string)
Step 4: Trust the certificate (so browsers stop complaining)
    certlm.msc → Enter (manages Local Computer certificates)
    Expand Personal → Certificates
    Find your new cert
    Right-click it → All Tasks → Export…
        Yes, export the private key → Next
        .PFX format → check "Include all certificates..." and "Exportable private key"
        Set a temporary password
Save pfx file: e.g. C:\temp\dev-cert.pfx

Step 5: Import it to Trusted Root Certification Authorities:
    Expand Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates
    Right-click → All Tasks → Import…
    Select your .pfx file
        → enter password
        → Place all certificates in: Trusted Root Certification Authorities

Cleanup:
    * List certs: Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Format-Table Subject, FriendlyName, Thumbprint, NotAfter
        ** This lists your Thumbprint also
    * Remove cert: Remove-Item -Path Cert:\LocalMachine\My\THUMBPRINT_HERE

MySQL setup:

1 = Log in as root (or another admin user): mysql -u root -p
    use \h prompt to see options, should be \g for sending a SQL command to server
2 = SQLCREATE USER 'webapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<YourPasswordHere>';
3 = (Optional but recommended) Create the database:SQLCREATE DATABASE `minimal-editor-api-db` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
4 = Grant privileges (this works even if the DB didn't exist yet when you ran step 2):
    SQLGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `minimal-editor-api-db`.* TO 'webapp'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Verification check:

Open CMD (admin):
Make sure Path variable knows MySQL location (or set termporarily for session):
    set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
mysql -u root -p

\g SHOW DATABASES;
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'webapp'@'localhost';

P.S. make sure your user uses old plugin or set options for new hashing plugin for mysql passwords, i.e.:

    ALTER USER 'webapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<YourPassword>'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Check:

    SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE User = 'webapp';
    should show:

+--------+-----------+-----------------------+
| User   | Host      | plugin                |
+--------+-----------+-----------------------+
| webapp | localhost | mysql_native_password | <== This is important
+--------+-----------+-----------------------+
