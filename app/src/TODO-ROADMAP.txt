NEXT UP:

* Global Loader (interceptors or without)
* Generate random background (Or select background actor on New)
** Image Actors & Backgrounds (Perhaps preferred color pallete, textures, & gradients)
* Copy-Paste actor (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V)
* Set up Controls & Behaviors for actors (proper validation/warnings included)
[ Projected Work ~ 2.5 weeks, have time to take a look at couple tutorials as well ]

** Render Scene (the bulk of the entire work => make Lua load scenes you created in Canva as close as possible)
** Test very basic Lua scripts (Gravitation or Scared enemy perhaps)
[ Projected Work ~ 5.5 weeks, have to make sure scripts are "stackable" i.e. modular and can be mixed-in]

* Interpretation of Scene sizes (editor minimap up top or left down under perhaps ?)
* Win-Conditions (win-condition scripts in Lua as well ?, victory/defeat screen/s perhaps..)
[ Projected Work ~ 2 weeks, have time to take a look at couple tutorials as well ]

** Publish Scene (after done with Render => this one will require arguably some Deployment logic as well)
[ The bulk of learning will happen here => publish a game scene and then render it remotely from a deployed location on cloud. Test on devices if possible, GL HF ]

Known BUGS (left behind):
* Background color change does not change unless color picker control gets reactivated.. :?
